<!--The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

Example-->
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

<!--The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

Example-->
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
